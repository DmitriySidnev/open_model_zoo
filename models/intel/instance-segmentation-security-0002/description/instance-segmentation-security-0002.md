# instance-segmentation-security-0002

## Use Case and High-Level Description

This model is an instance segmentation network for 80 classes of objects.
It is a Mask R-CNN with ResNet50 backbone, FPN, RPN, detection and
segmentation heads.

| Source framework                | PyTorch\*                                 |

Average Precision (AP) is defined and measured according to standard
[MS COCO evaluation procedure](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval).

## Performance

## Inputs

1.	name: `image` , shape: [1x3x768x1024] - An input image in the format
    [1xCxHxW]. The expected channel order is BGR.

## Outputs

1.	name: `labels`, shape: [1000, ] - Contiguous integer class ID for every
    detected object, '0' for background, i.e. no object.
2.	name: `boxes`, shape: [1000, 5] - Bounding boxes around every detected objects
    in (top_left_x, top_left_y, bottom_right_x, bottom_right_y) format and its
    confidence score in range [0, 1].
3.	name: `masks`, shape: [1000, 14, 14] - Segmentation heatmaps for every output
    bounding box.
